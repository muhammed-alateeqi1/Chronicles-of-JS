# Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has 7 primitive data types:

1. **String** → text values  
2. **Number** → integers and floats (e.g., 42, 3.14)  
3. **Boolean** → `true` or `false`  
4. **Undefined** → variable declared but not assigned  
5. **Null** → intentional empty value  
6. **Symbol** → unique value (introduced in ES6)  
7. **BigInt** → very large integers (introduced in ES11 / 2020)  

## Characteristics
- **Primitive values are immutable** → once created, their value cannot be changed.  
- They are **copied by value** (not by reference).
